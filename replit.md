# Overview

This is a working static HTML website successfully configured for the Replit environment. The project features a basic HTML structure with a heading and paragraph element, along with embedded JavaScript for analytics/tracking functionality. The website is now properly served via Python's HTTP server and configured for both development and production deployment.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML**: Single-file HTML approach using standard HTML5 structure
- **Inline JavaScript**: Analytics/tracking code embedded directly in the HTML head section
- **No Framework**: Pure HTML without any frontend frameworks or libraries
- **Minimal Styling**: No CSS styling implemented, relying on browser defaults
- **HTTP Server**: Python's built-in HTTP server serving content on port 5000
- **Replit Integration**: Configured to bind to 0.0.0.0 for proper proxy support

## File Structure
- Single `index.html` file serving as the entry point
- No separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Monolithic structure suitable for simple static content

## Design Decisions
- **Simplicity First**: Chosen for rapid prototyping or learning purposes
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML file can be opened in any browser without compilation
- **Embedded Scripts**: Analytics code included inline for immediate functionality
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for autoscale deployment on Replit with proper host binding

# External Dependencies

## Analytics/Tracking
- **Custom Analytics Script**: Embedded JavaScript with variables suggesting a content management or analytics system (NS_CSM_* variables)
- **Third-party Tracking**: The script references what appears to be a tracking or analytics service with specific IDs and collection parameters

## Browser Dependencies
- **Standard Web APIs**: Relies on basic HTML5 and JavaScript support available in modern browsers
- **No External Libraries**: No CDN links or external JavaScript/CSS framework dependencies identified
